                <p>NC_News was created in two parts.</p>
                <h3>Back-End</h3>
                <p>I began by building the database in PostgreSQL and creating a seed script to populate the database whilst practicing TDD using Jest and SuperTest.</p>
                <p>I knew the CRUD endpoints and queries I wanted the user to be able to access as part of an MVP so I built the API using express and started building model and controller functions to achieve this.</p>
                <p>Probably the biggest challenge I had when creating the back-end was tackling the error-handling middleware, but eventually I was able to incorporate functions that handled any reasonable errors a user might encounter.</p>
                <p>Finally I refactored my code to use express.Router as it resulted in much drier code.</p>
                <h3>Front-End</h3>
                <p>The front-end was created using React.js with Axios iteracting with the API.</p>
                <p>After I'd gathered some more experience working on my other projects I revisited NC_News and adopted tailwind.css with my main focus being creating a responsive design.</p>
