                <p>Handy was created as a group project within the NorthCoders bootcamp.</p>
                <p>As a group we listed several potential projects and decided on a mobile app that would serve as a marketplace for small DIY jobs, which could be bid on by local people for an agreed price.</p>
                <p>The central idea behind Handy was that it wouldn't be for businesses / professionals but local skilled people with time on their hands such as retirees.</p>
                <p>After planning wireframes of our app we split into two teams, one would focus on the back-end (which I was part of) and the other would get started on the front-end.  Whichever team finished first would assist the other.  This wasn't our ideal way of working, as we all wanted experience at each stage of development, however there were time constraints for this project.</p>
                <p>The back-end was simple enough, we used PostgreSQL to create databases and Axios connected the front-end to them.  The biggest challenges when creating the back-end was using the Postgis extension of PostgreSQL to determine locations based on postcode and incorporating the use of the phone camera for setting up new users and attaching photos to posted jobs.</p>
                <p>Once we were convinced the back-end was passing tests successfully, we moved onto the front-end which was for each of us our first foray into React Native.  As our intended users were likely to be of older age we focused on a simple UI.</p>
                <p>Our final submission for the project is the video posted above.</p>
